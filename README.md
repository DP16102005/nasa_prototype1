The Solar System
================

This is a project powered by Three.js and WebGL. All objects within this project have been modeled to scale based on real astronomical data. The scene currently renders the sun, all eight planets (nine if you side with Pluto being a planet), each planet's moons, the asteriod belt and thousands of stars.
